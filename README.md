# Machine Vision Bin-Picking System Using UNet

## Overview
This project is a Machine Vision Bin-Picking System that uses a **UNet-based convolutional neural network (CNN)** for object detection and segmentation in cluttered environments. It is designed to enable robotic arms to accurately detect, localize, and pick objects from bins, making it ideal for industrial automation.

The UNet model is implemented to provide precise object segmentation, crucial for tasks where multiple objects overlap or vary in shape and size.

## Features
- **Accurate Object Segmentation**: Uses UNet for high-quality pixel-level segmentation.
- **Versatile Applications**: Adaptable to different objects, shapes, and bin sizes.
- **Efficient for Robotic Automation**: Enables real-time decision-making for robotic arms.

## Getting Started
